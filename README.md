# Demo Codex Project

This repository has been initialized with a basic project structure to serve as a starting point for future development. The layout follows common conventions for organizing source code, documentation, automation scripts, and tests.

## Project Structure

- `src/` – Application source code lives here. Create modules, packages, and other implementation files in this directory.
- `tests/` – Automated tests for the project. Add unit, integration, or end-to-end tests as needed.
- `docs/` – Project documentation, design notes, and supporting materials.
- `scripts/` – Utility scripts for development, build, or deployment workflows.

Each directory currently contains a placeholder `.gitkeep` file so that the folder hierarchy is tracked by Git. Replace these placeholders as you add real project files.

## Getting Started

1. Add your application code under `src/` and supporting tests in `tests/`.
2. Update this README with project-specific instructions such as setup steps, usage examples, and contribution guidelines.
3. Remove the `.gitkeep` files once substantive content has been added to the corresponding directories.

Happy building!
